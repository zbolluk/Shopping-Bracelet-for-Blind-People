# Vibrational Guidance: Enhancing Grasping Ability for the Blind with Tactile Feedback

## Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate a vibrotactile bracelet that assists individuals with visual impairments in goal-directed hand movements and object grasping. The innovative device provides precise tactile feedback on the wrist, guiding users towards the location of objects while keeping the auditory channel unobstructed. Our study investigates the effectiveness of vibrotactile signals in comparison to traditional auditory cues during grasping tasks.

## Key Features
- **Vibrotactile Feedback**: Utilizes four vibration motors to convey directional information for object grasping without interfering with vital auditory cues.
- **User-Centered Design**: Developed with the specific needs of visually impaired individuals in mind, the bracelet is designed for ease of use and comfort during daily activities.
- **Mixed-Methods Approach**: Combines quantitative analysis (task performance metrics) and qualitative feedback (participant experiences) to assess the effectiveness of the device.
- **Experimentation**: Involves a series of localization and grasping tasks with 42 participants with varying degrees of visual impairment, providing critical insights into the device's performance and usability.

## Results
Initial findings suggest that while individuals performed faster when guided by auditory feedback, the tactile bracelet demonstrated significant potential in providing a non-intrusive means of support for grasping tasks. Participant feedback highlighted areas for improvement, contributing to future design iterations.

## Conclusion
This project not only addresses the challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments during daily tasks but also advances the development of assistive technology that enhances autonomy and quality of life. By refining tactile feedback mechanisms, we aim to create a practical solution for improved object manipulation.
