# Enhancing Grasping Ability with Vibrational Guidance for Individuals Who Are Blind or Partially Sighted

## Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate a vibrotactile bracelet that assists individuals with visual impairments in goal-directed hand movements and object grasping. The innovative device provides precise tactile feedback on the wrist, guiding users towards the location of objects. Our study investigates the effectiveness of vibrotactile signals in comparison to traditional auditory cues during grasping tasks.

## Key Features
This project follows a user-centered design approach to develop and test a wearable assistive device through the following steps:
- **System Design**: A vibrotactile bracelet using four vibration motors to provide directional guidance for Up, Down, Left, and Right, with a specific pulse cue for grasping movements.
- **Behavioral Experiment**: A study involving 42 participants with varying degrees of visual impairment to evaluate device performance during localization and grasping tasks.
- **User Questionnaire**: A detailed survey conducted to identify the specific needs of visually impaired individuals and to assess the bracelet’s comfort and ease of use in daily life.
- **Mixed-Methods Evaluation**: A combined analysis of quantitative metrics (speed and accuracy) and qualitative feedback from the questionnaires to provide a complete assessment of usability.

## Results
Our findings suggest that while individuals performed faster when guided by auditory feedback, the tactile bracelet demonstrated significant potential in providing a non-intrusive means of support for grasping tasks. Participant feedback highlighted areas for improvement, contributing to future design iterations.

## Conclusion
This project not only addresses the challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments during daily tasks but also advances the development of assistive technology that enhances autonomy and quality of life. By refining tactile feedback mechanisms, we aim to create a practical solution for improved object manipulation.
